# Project 3: [Around The U.S.](https://sari010101.github.io/se_project_aroundtheus/)

### What is it?

This is a project where the user can change images and texts to create their profile page.
The like-buttons indicate it is meant to be shared and appreciated.

### What for?

This is a project to study different responsive design tools, with basic html and CSS knowledge:

- **CSS Grid** is used without media queries.
  The layout shifts from 3 columns to 2 and to 1 and adapts to the screen size:

- **Media Queries** are used where the layout breaks.
  The Devtool shows where the media queries are:

- **Others**
  Use of ellipses to avoid text overflow, % instead of px for widths help against horizontal scrollbar, smooth scaling for a less pixelized appearance.

### What else?

I also learned in the process how to:

- use [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1) ,
  and about different formats like svg for logos, and png and their transparent background.

- download, connect and setup fonts.

- compress images on [tinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), so the project loads faster.

- add GIFs to README files.

- record videos to explain a project

#### Project 4 additions

- create a popup with JS

- create templates for the cards to avoid hard-coded HTML
