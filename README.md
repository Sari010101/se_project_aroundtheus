# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### What is it?

This is a project where the user can change images and texts to create their profile page.
The like-buttons indicate it is meant to be shared and appreciated.


### What for?

This is a project to study different responsive design tools, with basic html and CSS knowledge:
* __CSS Grid__ is used without media queries. The layout shifts from 3 columns to 2 and to 1 and adapts to the screen size:

* __Media Queries__ are used where the layout breaks. The Devtool shows where the media queries are:

* __Others__
Use of ellipses to avoid text overflow, % instead of px for widths help against horizontal scrollbar, smooth scaling for a less pixelized appearance.


### What else?

I also learned in the process how to:
* use[Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/ii4xxsJ0ghevUOcssTlHZv/Sprint-3%3A-Around-the-US?node-id=0%3A1)  ,
and about different formats like svg for logos, and png and their transparent background.

* use Google fonts, download and setup fonts.

* compress images on [tinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/), so the project loads faster. 

* add GIFs to README files.
